# Why use Phonon

## Scalability

Javascript: Phonon plugins are independent each other.
It is fine to use only one Phonon feature or component, but you will fall in love with all the features. :)

CSS: Phonon works perfectly with [Ratchet components](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet), but if you don't want to use this beautiful framework, it is okay. Just include phonon-minimal.css.

Additionally, you can choose your pattern in order to bind your UI dynamically.
Phonon is very open to the world of patterns.

## (A)synchronous Javascript

Navigator permits you to manage asynchronous and synchronous pages so that it becomes easy to organize your app tasks or processes as you desire.

## Internalization

A Phonon app is almost perfect, but an internationalized Phonon application, it's even better! 
The Linguistic plugin permits to manage your language files and to bind the correct language values inside your HTML view with attributes.

## Light-weight framework
The Phonon framework is really light, because its components can be loaded independently.

## 100% modular

**Do you love RequireJS? We do.**
Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code. 
Each Phonon component is compatible with asynchronous module definition (AMD).

## Cordova based plugins

Some plugins work with the Phonegap - Apache Cordova API such as Navigator, FileSystem & Notifications.
